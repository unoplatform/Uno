## Hotreload sample app

This sample app is separate for the purpose of validating hotreload behavior with the C# Hotreload workspace. It is a separate app to avoid spending a large amount of time parsing the Uno solution project structure.

When making changes, open the associated SLN file after having build the uno Skia.GTK samples app, the app should run when standalone.
