For more information about these prerequisites, see [Installing Xamarin](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/xamarin/get-started/installation/). For information about connecting Visual Studio to a Mac build host, see [Pair to Mac for Xamarin.iOS development](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/xamarin/ios/get-started/installation/windows/connecting-to-mac/).

## Finalize your environment setup using uno-check
* Install the uno-check tool:
   ```
   dotnet tool install -g Uno.Check

## Create an application from the solution template

To easily create a multi-platform application:
* Create a new C# solution using the **Multi-Platform App (Uno Platform | .NET 6 | UWP)** template, from Visual Studio's **Start Page**:
* Update to the latest NuGet package named `Uno.UI`. To get the very latest features, check the `pre-release` box.
* To debug the iOS:
    - In the "Debug toolbar" drop down, select framework `net6.0-ios`
    - Select an active device
    > Note that VS 2022 support for iOS is still a work in progress and may not deploy properly. Deploying to physical devices is not supported as of 17.1 Preview 1.
* To debug the Android platform:
    - In the "Debug toolbar" drop down, select framework `net6.0-android`
    - Select an active device in "Device" sub-menu
* To debug the UWP head:
    - Select the `Debug|x86` configuration
    - Debug the project
* To run the WebAssembly (Wasm) head:
   - Select **IIS Express** and press **Ctrl+F5** or choose 'Start without debugging' from the menu.

> Debugging the macOS and macCatalyst targets is not supported from Visual Studio on Windows.

### Make sure XAML Intellisense is enabled

[Intellisense](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/ide/using-intellisense) is supported in XAML when the UWP head is active:
![xaml-intellisense](Assets/quick-start/xaml-intellisense.png)

If XAML Intellisense isn't working on a freshly-created project, try the following steps:
1. Build the UWP head.
2. Close all XAML documents.
3. Close and reopen Visual Studio.
4. Reopen XAML documents.

### Troubleshooting Visual Studio and Uno Platform Installation Issues
