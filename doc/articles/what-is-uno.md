# About the Uno Platform

Uno Platform is a cross-platform application framework which lets you write an application once in XAML and C#, and deploy it to [any target platform](getting-started/requirements.md). 

Uno Platform's application API is compatible with Microsoft's [WinUI 3 API](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/apps/winui/winui3/) and the older [UWP application API](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/get-started/). In fact, when your application runs on Windows, it's just an ordinary WinUI 3 (or UWP) application. 

This means that existing WinUI or UWP code is compatible with the Uno Platform. Existing WinUI or UWP libraries can be recompiled for use in Uno Platform applications. A number of [3rd-party libraries](supported-libraries.md) have been ported to Uno Platform.

Uno Platform is pixel-perfect by design, delivering consistent visuals on every platform. At the same time, it rests upon the native UI framework on most target platforms, making it easy to [integrate native views](native-views.md) and tap into native platform features.
