### Usage

For general usage you can follow the documentation provided by [Microsoft](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/uwp/api/windows.system.power.powermanager).

### Limitations

#### Android

`RemainingChargePercentChanged` event is not updated continuously as there is no API that provides such events. It is triggered by system `Low` and `Ok` battery state broadcasts only. The `RemainingChargePercent` property always returns the up-to-date value. For continuous monitoring you can set up periodic polling.

#### WebAssembly

Before any of the properties/events of `PowerManager` can be accessed, the class needs to be initialized via a platform-specific `InitializeAsync` method:

```csharp
#if __HAS_UNO__
var isAvailable = await PowerManager.InitializeAsync();
#endif
```

If the returned value is `false`, refrain from using `PowerManager` in your code, as it is not available in the browser the user is using.
