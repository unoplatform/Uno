# Barometer

> [!TIP]
> This article covers Uno-specific information for `Barometer`. For a full description of the feature and instructions on using it, consult the UWP documentation: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/uwp/api/windows.devices.sensors.barometer

 * The `Windows.Devices.Sensors.Barometer` class allows measuring pressure in hectopascals (hPa).

## Supported features

| Feature        |  Windows  | Android |  iOS  |  Web (WASM)  | macOS | Linux (Skia)  | Win 7 (Skia) | 
|---------------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-|
| `GetDefault`         | ✔ | ✔ | ✔ | ✔ | ✔ | ✔ | ✔ |
| `ReadingChanged` | ✔ | ✔ | ✔ | ✖ | ✖ | ✖| ✖ |
| `ReportInterval`     | ✔ | ✔ | ✖ | ✖ | ✖ | ✖ | ✖ |

## Using Barometer with Uno
 
 * The `GetDefault` method is available on all targets and will return `null` on those which do not support `Barometer` or devices that do not have such a sensor.
 * Ensure to unsubscribe from the `ReadingChanged` event when you no longer need the readings, so that the sensor is no longer active to avoid unnecessary battery consumption.

## Example

### Capturing sensor readings

```csharp
var barometer = Barometer.GetDefault();
barometer.ReadingChanged += Barometer_ReadingChanged;

private async void Barometer_ReadingChanged(Barometer sender, BarometerReadingChangedEventArgs args)
{
    // If you want to update the UI in some way, ensure the Dispatcher is used,
    // as the ReadingChanged event handler does not run on the UI thread.
    await Dispatcher.RunAsync(CoreDispatcherPriority.Normal, () =>
    {
        OutputTextBlock.Text = $"Sensor reading in hPa = {args.Reading.StationPressureInHectopascals}, " +
            $"timestamp = {args.Reading.Timestamp}";
    });
}
```

### Unsubscribing from the readings

```csharp
barometer.ReadingChanged -= Barometer_ReadingChanged;
```
