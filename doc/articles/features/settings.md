# Settings

> [!TIP]
> This article covers Uno-specific information for managing user preferences. For a full description of the feature and instructions on using it, consult the UWP documentation: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/get-started/settings-learning-track

 * Settings API allows you to store the preferences of the user and preserve them across the launches of the application.

## Using Settings with Uno

 * On each target platform, the native user preferences APIs are used for storage.
 * `RoamingSettings` are not roamed across devices, as this feature has been disabled by UWP/WinUI

## Examples

ApplicationDataContainer localSettings = Windows.Storage.ApplicationData.Current.LocalSettings;
localSettings.Values["MySettingName"] = "A user setting";
```

### Reading a setting

```csharp
ApplicationDataContainer localSettings = Windows.Storage.ApplicationData.Current.LocalSettings;
