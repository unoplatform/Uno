# Using the Skia+WPF head

Uno Platform supports running applications using a WPF shell, using a Skia backend rendering. WPF is used to create a shell for the application to be used on various versions of Windows, going back to Windows 7.

> [!Tip]
> For a step-by-step guide to installing the prerequisites for your preferred IDE and environment, consult the [Get Started guide](../get-started.md).

## Anatomy of the Skia+WPF project
When creating a Skia+WPF solution, you will get the project head and a Class Library project.

### The head project
The project head contains the WPF assets, XAML and C# files for the WPF part of the app (the shell).

The XAML files in this project are using the WPF syntax and APIs, and contain a `ContentControl` in which the WinUI/Uno content will be drawn.

### The Class Library project
The app's Class Library project contains the WinUI part of the app. This is where most of your app code will be located.

### Hardware Acceleration

Starting from Uno Platform 4.8, OpenGL acceleration is enabled by default. It is possible to control the render surface type by setting the `RenderSurfaceType` property.

In the `MainWindow.xaml.cs` file, change:

```csharp
root.Content = new global::Uno.UI.Skia.Platform.WpfHost(Dispatcher, () => new MyApp.AppHead());
```
to:

```csharp
var host = new global::Uno.UI.Skia.Platform.WpfHost(Dispatcher, () => new MyApp.AppHead());
host.RenderSurfaceType = RenderSurfaceType.Software;

root.Content = host;
```

### Hosting Native WPF Controls

Hosting native WPF controls is supported through `ContentPresenter` and `ContentControl`.

See this documentation about [embedding native controls](using-skia-embed-native-controls.md).

## Upgrading to a later version of SkiaSharp

By default Uno comes with a set of **SkiaSharp** dependencies set by the **[Uno.UI.Runtime.Skia.Gtk](https://nuget.info/packages/Uno.UI.Runtime.Skia.Gtk)** package. 

If you want to upgrade **SkiaSharp** to a later version, you'll need to specify all packages individually in your project as follows:

```xml
<ItemGroup>
   <PackagReference Include="SkiaSharp" Version="2.88.3" /> 
   <PackagReference Include="SkiaSharp.Harfbuzz" Version="2.88.3" /> 
   <PackagReference Include="SkiaSharp.NativeAssets.Linux" Version="2.88.3" /> 
   <PackageReference Update="SkiaSharp.NativeAssets.macOS" Version="2.88.3" />
</ItemGroup>
```

## Upgrading from earlier versions of the Uno Platform template

In previous versions of the Uno Platform template, the Skia+WPF support was split in two projects.

This is not required anymore, but to be able to use a single project, you'll can either:
- Recreate your project from the templates and migrate your code to the new project
- Make some adjustments to your projects:
    1. From the `MyProject.Skia.Wpf.csproj` :
        - Copy the last `<Import Project="..." Label="Shared" />` line to `MyProject.Skia.Wpf.csproj`
        - Copy the `Microsoft.Extensions.Logging` and `Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.Console` lines to `MyProject.Skia.Wpf.csproj`
    1. Delete the `MyProject.Skia.Wpf.csproj`
    1. Rename `MyProject.Skia.Wpf.Host.csproj` to `MyProject.Skia.Wpf.csproj`
    1. In the `MyProject.Shared.projitems`, add the following code just before the last `</ItemGroup>` line:
        ```xml
        <!-- Mark the files from this folder as being part of WinUI -->
		<Page Update="$(MSBuildThisFileDirectory)**/*.xaml" XamlRuntime="WinUI" />
		<ApplicationDefinition Update="$(MSBuildThisFileDirectory)**/*.xaml" XamlRuntime="WinUI" />

		<!-- Make sure XAML files force reevaluation of up-to-date checks -->
		<UpToDateCheckInput Include="$(MSBuildThisFileDirectory)**/*.xaml" />
        ```
        You'll need edit this file outside of Visual Studio. You need an example, create a new temporary project, and take a look at the way these lines are defined in the shared project file.
