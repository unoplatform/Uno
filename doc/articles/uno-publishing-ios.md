# Publishing Your App for iOS

## Preparing For Publish

## Building your app

### Packaging your app using the CLI

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Publishing for iOS is only supported on macOS

First, you'll need to setup to be able to build iOS apps. You can follow [these steps for publishing .NET iOS apps](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/maui/ios/deployment/?view=net-maui-8.0).

Then, you'll need to setup your `csproj` to include the signing information:

```xml
<Choose>
    <When Condition="$([MSBuild]::GetTargetPlatformIdentifier('$(TargetFramework)')) == 'ios'">
       <PropertyGroup Condition="'$(Configuration)'=='Release'">
         <CodesignKey>iPhone Distribution</CodesignKey>
         <RuntimeIdentifier>ios-arm64</RuntimeIdentifier>
       </PropertyGroup>
    </When>
</Choose>
```

To build your app from the CLI on macOS:

- Open a terminal, command line, or powershell
- Navigate to your `csproj` folder
- Publish the app using:

  ```shell
  dotnet publish -f net8.0-ios -c Release -o ./publish
  ```

The output `.ipa` file will be in the `publish` folder.

## Publishing your app on the App Store

Publishing your app is done through [the transporter app](https://developer.apple.com/help/app-store-connect/manage-builds/upload-builds) on macOS.
