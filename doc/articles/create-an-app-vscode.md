# Creating an app with VS Code

> [!NOTE]
> Make sure to setup your environment by [following our instructions](xref:Uno.GetStarted.vscode).

### Create the App

In a terminal, type the following to create a new project using [`dotnet new`](xref:Uno.GetStarted.dotnet-new) templates:

```bash
dotnet new unoapp -o MyApp --preset=blank -platforms android ios maccatalyst wasm gtk --vscode
```

> [!TIP]
> `MyApp` is the name you want to give to your project.

This will create a blank template app that only contains the WebAssembly, Skia+GTK and Mobile platforms support.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Apple targets cannot be built under Linux. If you are using Linux, you'll need to remove `ios` and `maccatalyst` from the `platforms` list. The previous command would become `dotnet new unoapp -o MyApp -preset=blank -platforms wasm gtk android --vscode`.

Next, open the project using Visual Studio Code:
* In the terminal type the following:
    ```bash
    code ./MyApp
    ```

* Visual Studio Code might ask to restore the NuGet packages. Allow it to restore them if asked.
* Once the project has been loaded, in the status bar at the bottom left of VS Code, `MyApp.sln` is selected by default. Select `MyApp.Wasm.csproj`, `MyApp.Skia.Gtk.csproj` or `MyApp.Mobile.csproj` instead.

## Debug the App

Uno Platform provides integrated support for debugging your app on Windows, mac and Linux.

# [**WebAssembly**](#tab/Wasm)

1. In the debugger section of the [activity bar](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/userinterface) select `Debug (Chrome, WebAssembly)`
1. In the status bar, ensure the `MyApp.Wasm.csproj` project is selected - by default `MyApp.sln` is selected.
1. Press `F5` to start the debugging session

# [**Skia GTK**](#tab/skiagtk)

1. In the debugger section of the [activity bar](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/userinterface) select `Skia.GTK (Debug)`
1. In the status bar, ensure the `MyApp.Skia.Gtk.csproj` project is selected - by default `MyApp.sln` is selected.
1. Press `F5` to start the debugging session

Note that C# Hot Reload is not available when running with the debugger. In order to use C# Hot Reload, run the app using the following:

- On Windows, type the following:

    ```bash
    $env:DOTNET_MODIFIABLE_ASSEMBLIES="debug"
    dotnet run
    ```

- On Linux or macOS:

    ```bash
    export DOTNET_MODIFIABLE_ASSEMBLIES=debug
    dotnet run
    ```

# [**Android**](#tab/androiddebug)

- In the status bar, select the `MyApp.Mobile` project - by default `MyApp.sln` is selected.

  ![mobile project name](Assets/quick-start/vs-code-debug-project.png)
- To the right of `MyApp.Mobile`, click on the target framework to select `net8.0-android | Debug`

  ![android target framework](Assets/quick-start/vs-code-debug-tf-android.png)
- Then, to the right of the target framework, select the device to debug with. You will need to connect an android device, or create an Android simulator.

  ![android device name](Assets/quick-start/vs-code-debug-device-android.png)
- Finally, in the debugger side menu, select the `Uno Platform Mobile` profile
- Either press `F5` or press the green arrow to start the debugging session.

# [**iOS**](#tab/iosdebug)

> [!NOTE]
> Debugging for iOS is only possible when running locally (or remotely through [Remote SSH](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-ssh)) on a macOS machine.

- In the status bar, select the `MyApp.Mobile` project - by default `MyApp.sln` is selected.

  ![mobile project name](Assets/quick-start/vs-code-debug-project.png)
- To the right of `MyApp.Mobile`, click on the target framework to select `net8.0-ios | Debug`

  ![ios target framework](Assets/quick-start/vs-code-debug-tf-ios.png)
- Then, to the right of the target framework, select the device to debug with. You will need to connect an iOS device, or use an existing iOS simulator.

  ![ios device](Assets/quick-start/vs-code-debug-device-ios.png)
- Finally, in the debugger side menu, select the `Uno Platform Mobile` profile
- Either press `F5` or press the green arrow

> [!TIP]
> When deploying to an iOS device, you may encounter the following error: `errSecInternalComponent`. In such case, you'll need to unlock your keychain from a terminal inside VS Code by running the following command: `security unlock-keychain`

# [**Mac Catalyst**](#tab/catalystdebug)

> [!NOTE]
> Debugging for Mac Catalyst is only possible when running locally (or remotely through [Remote SSH](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-ssh)) on a macOS machine.

- In the status bar, select the `MyApp.Mobile` project - by default `MyApp.sln` is selected.

  ![mobile project name](Assets/quick-start/vs-code-debug-project.png)
- To the right of `MyApp.Mobile`, click on the target framework to select `net8.0-maccatalyst | Debug`

  ![catalyst target framework](Assets/quick-start/vs-code-debug-tf-catalyst.png)
- Finally, in the debugger side menu, select the `Uno t Mobile` profile
- Either press `F5` or press the green arrow to start the debugging session.
