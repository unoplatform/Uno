Uno platform lets you decide easily which theme or skin to display throughout your app.

This option sets the generated theme or skin to be used in the generated app. The options available are:
    
- **Material**  
    Material is Google's design system.  
    Learn more about [Material](https://material.io/).

    The generated project will have the material theme applied:

The Uno Platform Template Wizard uses the Material theme.

The theme in the application can be further customized with the following options:

- **Theme Service**  
    Includes references to the Uno.Extensions.Core.WinUI package which includes the theme service that can be used to control the theme (Dark, Light or System) of the application.  

- **Import DSP**  
    Allows colors in the application to be overridden using a DSP file (Material theme only).
