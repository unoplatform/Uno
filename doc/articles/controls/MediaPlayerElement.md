#### Notes

* Uno's MediaPlayerElement relies on AVPlayer for iOS and AndroidMediaPlayer for Android. Please refer to those native players documentation for more information about supported audio and video formats
* If you need to set source programmatically (i.e., using `_mediaPlayerElement.Source = [source]`), please note that only sources created with `MediaSource.CreateFromUri()` are currently supported

## Requirement

### iOS

Add the following to your info.plist

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
	<key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
	<true/>
	<key>NSExceptionMinimumTLSVersion</key>
	<string>TLSv1.2</string>
</dict>
```

__Note:__ Don't just copy/paste, but properly setup `NSAppTransportSecurity` as required by your project

### Android

Add the following to your AndroidManifest.xml

```xml
<!-- Required to play remote media -->
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET" />
<!-- Required to keep the screen on while playing -->
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WAKE_LOCK" />
```

### WebAssembly
Using the `MediaPlayerElement` on WebAssembly head requires adding the [`Uno.WinUI.MediaPlayer.WebAssembly`](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Uno.WinUI.MediaPlayer.WebAssembly) package to the `MyApp.Wasm` project. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The `Uno.WinUI.MediaPlayer.WebAssembly` package version must use the same version as the other `Uno.WinUI.*` packages in your project.

> [!NOTE]
> When using UWP APIs and the `Uno.UI.*` packages, you'll need to install the [`Uno.UI.MediaPlayer.WebAssembly`](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Uno.UI.MediaPlayer.WebAssembly) package instead.

### Skia.GTK
Using the `MediaPlayerElement` on the Skia+GTK head requires adding the [`Uno.WinUI.MediaPlayer.Skia.Gtk`](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Uno.WinUI.MediaPlayer.Skia.Gtk) package to the `MyApp.Skia.Gtk` project. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The `Uno.WinUI.MediaPlayer.Skia.Gtk` package version must use the same version as the other `Uno.WinUI.*` packages in your project.

> [!NOTE]
> When using UWP APIs and the `Uno.UI.*` packages, you'll need to install the [`Uno.UI.MediaPlayer.Skia.Gtk`](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Uno.UI.MediaPlayer.Skia.Gtk) package instead.

#### Skia+GTK on Linux
The `MediaPlayerElement` support is based on libVLC, and needs the system to provide the appropriate libraries to work properly.

You'll need to install the following packages (Debian based distros):

```
sudo apt-get install libvlc-dev libx11-dev vlc libgtk2.0-0 libx11dev
```

#### Skia+GTK on Windows
Running the `MediaPlayerElement` requires adding the [`VideoLAN.LibVLC.Windows`](https://www.nuget.org/packages/VideoLAN.LibVLC.Windows) package to your application.

## Future improvement

- React to audio focus changes (pause/stop playback or reduce audio volume)
- Subtitles support
- Languages support
- Buffering of next playlist element when using MediaPlaybackList
- Cast to device
- Playlist for Wasm
- Download option

## Known issues

- `[iOS]` Volume flyout does not display (Uno issue)
- `[All]` Dynamic width/height not supported when playing audio
- `[All]` Sometimes flickers during resizing when using dynamic width/height
