# dotnet new templates for Uno Platform

The Uno Platform provides a set of command-line templates to create cross-platform applications.

To install the templates, type the following:

# [**.NET 7**](#tab/net7)

```
dotnet new install Uno.Templates
```
# [**.NET 6**](#tab/net6)

```
dotnet new -i Uno.Templates
```
***

To determine all parameters available for a template use `dotnet new [templatename] -h`.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Installing the templates is done per dotnet CLI version. Meaning that the templates are installed for the version shown by `dotnet --version`. If you tried to use the templates with a version different than the one you used for installing, you'll get "No templates found matching: '<template-name>'." error.
>
> This is common when using `global.json` that alters the .NET CLI/SDK version. Specifically, it's common for the UI Test template.

> [!NOTE]
> When using .NET 6, use `dotnet new -i Uno.Templates` instead.

## Uno Platform Application

This template can be used to create a multi-platform application for iOS, Android, WebAssembly, Mac Catalyst, Linux, and Win32 Desktop which uses the new WinUI 3 APIs.

It comes with the **Blank** and **Recommended** presets.

To create a blank template, using minimal dependencies:
```
dotnet new unoapp -preset=blank -o test
```

To create from a recommended template, using [Uno.Extensions](xref:Overview.Extensions):
```
dotnet new unoapp -preset=recommended -o test
```

> [!NOTE]
> It is possible to create a .NET 6 template by using the `-tfm net6.0` parameter.

## Uno Platform Blank Application (UWP)

This template can be used to create a blank multi-platform application for iOS, Android, WebAssembly, macOS, Skia/GTK (Windows, Linux, macOS), and Skia/Wpf (Windows 7 and 10), using the UWP

A basic example:
```
dotnet new unoapp-uwp -o MyApp
```

A more advanced example that will not generate the android and macOS heads:

```
dotnet new unoapp-uwp -o MyApp -android=false -macos=false
```

## Uno Platform Blank Application (UWP, .NET 6)

This template can be used to create a blank multi-platform application for iOS, Android, WebAssembly, macOS, Mac Catalyst, Skia/GTK (Windows, Linux, macOS), and Skia/Wpf (Windows 7 and 10).

This template uses a single project head for iOS, Android, macOS, and Mac Catalyst. It requires Visual Studio 2022.

A basic example:
```
dotnet new unoapp-uwp-net6 -o MyApp
```

A more advanced example that will not generate the android and macOS heads:

```
dotnet new unoapp-uwp-net6 -o MyApp --Mobile=false
```

## Uno Platform Extensions

Uno Platform provides an enhanced template to build your application with less effort.

See [this documentation](xref:Overview.Features) for more information.

## Uno Platform Blank library

This template can be used to create a blank library. With this type of library, Skia and WebAssembly do not need to be built separately, but cannot be differentiated.

A basic example:
```
dotnet new unolib -o MyUnoLib
```

## Uno Platform Blank Cross-Runtime library

This template can be used to create a blank cross-runtime library, when platform specific code needs to be created for Skia and WebAssembly.

A basic example:
```
dotnet new unolib-crossruntime -o MyCrossRuntimeLibrary
```

## Uno Platform Uno.UITest library
This templates creates a project for creating and running UI Tests based on [Uno.UITest](https://github.com/unoplatform/Uno.UITest).

Considering you've created an application as follows:
- `dotnet new unoapp -o MyApp`

To create a UI Tests library:
- Create a folder name `MyApp\MyApp.UITests`
- In that folder, run `dotnet new unoapp-uitest`

This will automatically add the new project to the existing solution.

For additional information about UI Tests creation, visit the [Uno.UITest](https://github.com/unoplatform/Uno.UITest) documentation.

### Uninstalling the templates

Using a command line or terminal, run the following command:

`dotnet new -u Uno.Templates`
