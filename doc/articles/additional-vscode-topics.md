## Updating an existing application to work with VS Code

An existing application needs additional changes to be debugged properly.

1. At the root of the workspace, create a folder named `.vscode`
2. Inside this folder, create a file named `launch.json` and copy the [contents of this file](https://github.com/unoplatform/uno.templates/blob/main/src/Uno.Templates/content/unoapp/.vscode/launch.json).
3. Replace all instances of `MyExtensionsApp._1` with your application's name in `launch.json`.
4. Inside this folder, create a file named `tasks.json` and copy the [contents of this file](https://github.com/unoplatform/uno.templates/blob/main/src/Uno.Templates/content/unoapp/.vscode/tasks.json).
